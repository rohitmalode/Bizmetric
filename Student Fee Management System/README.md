Contents  
Python Script (.py) – Connects Python (VS Code) to SQL Server and allows:  
Storing student fee records and transaction details in the database.  
Calculating total fees dynamically based on selected options.  
Generating a student fee bill in the terminal or as a .txt file if requested.  

Database (SQL Server) – Stores student information including:  
Subject selected, analytics option, hostel, food, transport charges, and total fee.  

Usage  
Open the Python script in VS Code.  
Ensure SQL Server (SSMS) is running and the database credentials in the script are correct.  
Run the script in a Python 3.x environment.  
Enter student details as prompted in the menu-driven system.  
Choose whether to generate a hard copy (.txt) bill or display it in the terminal.  
Verify stored student records directly in SSMS if needed.  

Notes  
This project demonstrates practical implementation of OOP concepts with database integration.  
Includes structured classes for Student, Fee Calculation, Bill Generation, and Database Management.  
Make sure Python 3.x and required libraries (e.g., pyodbc) are installed before running the project.
