# Bizmetric Repository

This repository contains Python projects and exercises demonstrating various programming concepts, database connectivity, and practical applications. It is organized into several subfolders, each focusing on a specific topic or task.  

## Subfolders

### 1. Python Assignment
Contains assignments downloaded from Google Colab, covering:
- Functions
- User Input
- Pattern Matching
- Indexing
- Database Connectivity

### 2. List Comprehension & Lambda Functions
Includes around 50 practice questions and solutions focused on:
- Python list comprehensions
- Lambda (anonymous) functions
- Beginner to intermediate exercises for skill building

### 3. Python Test
Contains test exercises to evaluate understanding of Python concepts such as:
- Pattern Matching
- Dictionary operations
- Min/Max calculations
- Interest rate computations

### 4. Bill Printing
Demonstrates connecting Python (VS Code) to SQL Server (SSMS) to:
- Store user input in database tables
- Update database dynamically
- Includes ERD and UML diagrams

### 5. ERD, UML & Bill Generation
Shows a practical hotel billing system using Python and SQL Server:
- Accepts customer and order details
- Stores transactions in the database
- Optionally generates a hotel bill in `.txt` format
- Includes ERD and UML diagrams

## Usage
1. Navigate to the relevant subfolder.
2. Open Python scripts in VS Code or any preferred editor.
3. Run the scripts in Python 3.x environment.
4. For database-related scripts, ensure SQL Server (SSMS) is running and credentials are correctly set.
5. Follow on-screen instructions for input.

## Notes
- All scripts are intended for learning, practice, and demonstration purposes.
- Required libraries include Python 3.x and relevant packages (`pyodbc`, `pymssql`, etc.) for database operations.
- Images provided (ERD/UML) help understand the database and application structure.
